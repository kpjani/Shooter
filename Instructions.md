# **Reload. Aim. Shoot!**

**Rules**

You have 3 targets in front of you.
Hitting the inner circle of any of the 3 target will earn you a score of 100,
while hitting the outer one will give you 50.

**Be warned!**  If you miss the target at any time, your score will become 0. *Remember -  Consistancy is the key!*

And yes, don't try to get too close to the target. Stay to the left of the line while shooting. *No prizes for cheating!*

Load your gun and pull the trigger when you are ready. Happy Shooting! :-)
